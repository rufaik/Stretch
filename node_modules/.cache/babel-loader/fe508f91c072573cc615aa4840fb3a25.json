This leads into a video on how pearls and diamonds are made and how pressure creates strength.

An interactive poll is taken on how many girls feel like they know their bra size. How to choose the right bra is then explained, this leads into Her Period  and another interactive poll is taken to show who thinks they understand how their period works. A woman\\u2019s menstrual cycle is explained and this leads into the final session of Her-Self-esteem which is HerPurpose, here it is explained that every person has a purpose and the balance between dreaming big and implementing basic healthy habits into our lives The programme ends with a Q&A session.

decisions. \n\t\t\t\t\t\tParticipants are shown various images such as the Mona Lisa, a £10 note and a pearl and are asked the value of it, leading into an explanation on an individual’s pricelessness. This leads into a video on how pearls and diamonds are made and how pressure creates strength. This section ends with how self-discipline affects our thoughts and help students be healtier and happier \n\t\t\t\t\t\tNext we cover Her Bra and Kemi discusses the moment she realised that a bra was not a sexual object to be leered at but part of a woman’s uniform and it could be as pretty or as basic as she desired but it was not just meant for others, it was Hers. An interactive poll is taken on how many girls feel like they know their bra size. How to choose the right bra is then explained, this leads into Her Period  and another interactive poll is taken to show who thinks they understand how their period works. A woman’s menstrual cycle is explained and this leads into the final session of Her-Self-esteem which is HerPurpose, here it is explained that every person has a purpose and the balance between dreaming big and implementing basic healthy habits into our lives\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe programme ends with a Q&A session.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tTopics covered: Her Period, Her Bra and Her Self-esteem.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t    </td>\n\t\t\t\t\t  </tr>\n\t\t\t\t</table>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t<div id=\"2\" style = {{color: 'gray'}} className = \"apple gray f3 pb3 pt4\"  > Programme 2 </div>\n\t\t\t\t<div className= \"apple gray pl4\">\n\t\t\t\t<table>\n\t\t\t\t\t  <tr>\n\t\t\t\t\t    <td>Number of Participants&nbsp;</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t    <td>5-200</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t    \n\t\t\t\t\t  </tr>\n\t\t\t\t\t  <tr>\n\t\t\t\t\t    <td>Duration</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t    <td>3 x 1 hour session</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t  </tr>\n\t\t\t\t\t  <tr>\n\t\t\t\t\t    <td>Modules</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t    <td>Her Self-esteem, Her Bra, Her Period</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t  </tr>\n\t\t\t\t\t  <tr>\n\t\t\t\t\t    <td>Aims</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t    <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t    Help girls to develop their self-esteem, build and establish their confidence, help them to understand their personal value and unlock hidden potential\n   \t\t\t\t\t </td>\n\t\t\t\t\t  </tr>\n\t\t\t\t\t  <tr className=\"no-bottom-border\">\n\t\t\t\t\t    <td>Course Summary</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t    <td >\n\t\t\t\t\t    This programme takes the time to look at each topic in Her Self-esteem and really build a young person’s self-esteem.
